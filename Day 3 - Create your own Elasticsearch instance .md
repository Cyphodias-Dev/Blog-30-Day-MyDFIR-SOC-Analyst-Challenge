## Day 3 - Create your own Elasticsearch instance 
**Objective:  Learn how to spin up your own Elasticsearch instance.**

I created my Elasticsearch instance in the cloud with MyDFIR's $300 credit through VULTR cloud services.  I was able to setup a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that will contain all of the virtual machines.  Next I set up a VM running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (80GB NVMe storage, 4 vcores, & 16 GB memory) and was able to SSH into it from my host PC.  I copied the link from Elasticsearch's download page (platform DEB x86_64) [https://elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch](https://elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and installed it on my Ubuntu instance.  Once completed, I configured a firewall all within the initial VPC.  The only real modifications that needed to be done was to update the Ubuntu distro and modify the Elasticsearch YAML file for the proper IP address and port so the SOC Analyst instance will be able to connect to it.
