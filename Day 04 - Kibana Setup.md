## Day 4 - Kibana Setup
**Objective:  Learn how to install your own Kibana instance.**

From the following URL [https://elastic.co/downloads/kibana](https://elastic.co/downloads/kibana) I copied the link after choosing the platform DEB x86_64. and within the same Ubuntu VM we installed Elastcisearch where we downloaded the Kibana deb file using the following command `wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-8.15.0-amd64.deb`.
